# Analysis #1

Describe your first analysis here.

# Analysis #2

In this analysis, we aim to investigate the differences in CO2 production between the first year data was available (1992) and the most recent year data was available (2018) for a certain country. In this analysis, we will perform a Null Hypothesis test where Ho = 𝜇1 - 𝜇2 = 0 and HA = 𝜇1 - 𝜇2 ≠ 0 with the significance level being p \< 0.05 where 𝜇1 represents the average CO2 emissions for a certain country in 1992 and 𝜇2 represents the average CO2 emissions of a certain country in 2018.  The response variable will be CO2 emissions corresponding to the years between 1992 and 2018. We will report the confidence interval and the p-value, as well as include visualizations of the relationship between time and CO2. Regardless of the outcome, we will include the findings in our final report.
