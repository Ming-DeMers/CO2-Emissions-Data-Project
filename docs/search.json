However, because we do not use or think in terms of log odds, we can further interpret this intercept by evaluating p. The odds, \\(\\frac {p}{1-p}\\), of a country being “developed” if total CO2 emissions is 0 is \\(e ^ {-5.14 \\times 10 ^ {-1}}\\) where p represents the probability that the country is developed. Thus, given that total CO2 emissions is 0, the probability a country is developed is \\(e ^ {-5.14 \\times 10 ^ {-1}} - e ^ {-5.14 \\times 10 ^{-1}} p\\)."
