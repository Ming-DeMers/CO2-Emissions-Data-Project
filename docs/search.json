Your data description should be about your analysis-ready data.\n\nMotivation\n\nFor what purpose was the dataset created?\n\nThe dataset was created to show how emissions are changing in each country and allows for comparisons of various countries and regions in relation to overall emission trends along with their sources.\n\nWho created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?\n\nThe Our World in Data team created the original dataset on behalf of the Our World in Data project, which is a project of the Global Change Data Lab (a non-profit organization based in the United Kingdom), and the current dataset we will be using is a subset from the original dataset from the CORGIS Dataset Project created by Sam Donald.\n\nWho funded the creation of the dataset?\n\nThe Global Change Data Lab funded the creation of the dataset and it is a registered charity in England and Wales. Their work is made possible by donations of individuals and organizations that have made contributions to support their project.\n\n\n\n\nComposition\n\nWhat do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?\n\nThe instances that comprise the dataset represent countries (per year from 1992 to 2018).\n\nHow many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?\n\nThere are 2484 instances total.\n\nWhat are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?\n\nThe observations (rows) are countries per year.\nThe attributes (columns) are year, country name, country code, country GDP, country population, emissions production CH4, emissions production N2O, emissions production CO2 cement, emissions production CO2 coal, emissions production CO2 gas, emissions production CO2 oil, emissions production CO2 flaring, emissions production CO2 other, emissions production CO2 total, emissions global share CO2 cement, emissions global share CO2 coal, emissions global share CO2 gas, emissions global share CO2 oil, emissions global share CO2 flaring, emissions global share CO2 total.\n\n\n\n\nCollection Process\n\nHow was the data associated with each instance acquired?\n\nThe original dataset is built upon a number of datasets and processing steps. The datasets that were processed include Statistical review of world energy (BP), International energy data (EIA), Primary energy consumption (Our World in Data based on BP’s Statistical review of world energy & EIA’s International energy data), Global carbon budget - Fossil CO2 emissions (Global Carbon Project), Global carbon budget - Global carbon emissions (Global Carbon Project), Global carbon budget - National fossil carbon emissions (Global Carbon Project), Global carbon budget - National land-use change carbon emissions (Global Carbon Project), Global carbon budget (Our World in Data based on the Global Carbon Project’s Fossil CO2 emissions, Global carbon emissions, National fossil carbon emissions, and National land-use change emissions), Greenhouse gas emissions (including methane and nitrous oxide) by sector (CAIT), CO2 dataset (Our World in Data based on all sources above), Population (Our World in Data based on a number of different sources), and GDP (University of Groningen GGDC’s Maddison Project Database, Bolt and van Zanden, 2020). The current dataset we are using extracts from the original dataset.\n\nWhat processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n\nThe current dataset we will use depends on the datasets it was built off of and how they were processed, so if certain countries or emission data were left out of those datasets, they will also be left out of our dataset.\n\nIf people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n\nThere were no people involved in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\nPreprocessing/cleaning/labeling\n\nWhat preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n\nThe various datasets that were the foundation for the original dataset underwent processing steps (the codes of which can be found at this website, https://github.com/owid/co2-data), the names of countries and regions were standardized, the carbon emissions were recalculated to CO2 (e.g. from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of CO2 using a conversion factor of 3.664), and per capita figures were calculated from the dataset’s “Population” metric, which is included in the complete dataset and the population figures were sourced from Gapminder and the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPP).\nThe current dataset we will use is a subset of the original dataset, with all the tonnes units converted into kilotons and the variable names altered.\n\nIs the software that was used to preprocess/clean/label the data available?\n\nThe link for the software and code that was used to preprocess/clean/label the data: https://github.com/owid/co2-data\n\n\n\n\n\nData limitations\nIdentify any potential problems with your dataset.\n\nNot all 195 countries are in our dataset, which limits the scope of our dataset a bit.\nThe years within the dataset only range from 1992 to 2018, which could be a limitation because the range is 26 years, which may or may not be a long enough time period to see substantive changes in GDP or CO2 emissions. Additionally, this dataset does not contain data for more recent years, which could be another limitation if we want to see the most up-to-date data on GDP/emissions for different countries.\n\n\n\nExploratory data analysis\nPerform an (initial) exploratory data analysis.\n\n#average GDP of countries\npollution |>\n  group_by(Country.Name) |>\n  summarize(mean =

countries (between 1992 and 2018) in the dataset were calculated and can be found in the second displayed tibble.\nThrough visualizing the change in GDP over time for the two developed (United States and Japan) countries and the two developing countries (Pakistan and Vietnam), it can be seen that it appears that developing countries have a much higher rate of increase in GDP over time than developed countries do. However, as expected, the developing countries have much lower GDPs than developed countries in general.\nThrough visualizing the change in total CO2 emissions over time for the two developed (United States and Japan) countries and the two developing countries (Pakistan and Vietnam), it can be seen that it appears that developing countries have a much higher rate of increase in total CO2 emissions over time than developed countries do. Additionally, developed countries’ total CO2 emissions don’t appear to vary too much over the years, staying at a relatively high emission rate. Furthermore, as expected, despite higher rates of increase in the total CO2 emissions over time for developing countries, developed countries tend to have much higher total CO2 emissions overall than developing countries.\nThe observations above could indicate a possible correlation between GDP growth and an increase in CO2 emissions. It could also indicate that developed countries tend to produce much more CO2 than developing countries, contributing much more to climate change, but that there is a upward trend in development in developing countries that is also increasing CO2 emissions.\nThe graphs of “Total CO2 Emissions vs. Country GDP in 2018” and “Total CO2 Emissions vs. Country GDP in 1992” demonstrate a potential positive linear relationship between GDP and total CO2 emissions for the different countries across the years of 1992 to 2018.\n\n\nQuestions for reviewers\nList specific questions for your peer reviewers and project mentor to answer in giving you feedback on this phase.\n\nDo we need to convert the names of the variables/columns in the dataset to have underscores and all lowercase letters like the variables we usually use, or is it okay to leave them as is.\nIs the 2014 definition of what a developed vs developing country is as defined by the United Nations not recent enough of a definition?\nAre our research questions interesting enough/feasible?"

    "text": "Analysis #1\nIn this analysis, we intend to explore how global CO2 emissions correlate with the GDP growth rate for developing versus developed countries. Our analysis will use linear regression to model the relationship between GDP growth rate and global CO2 emissions. Examining the latest year, 2018, we will conduct a correlation test between CO2, the explanatory variable, and GDP, the response variable of the country groups. We would report the regression coefficient and R2 value and include visualizations of the relationship between the two variables. Regardless of correlation, we will include the findings in the final report.\n\n\nAnalysis #2\nIn this analysis, we aim to investigate the differences in CO2 production between the first year data was available (1992) and the most recent year data was available (2018) for a certain country. In this analysis, we will perform a Null Hypothesis test where Ho = 𝜇1 - 𝜇2 = 0 and HA = 𝜇1 - 𝜇2 ≠ 0 with the significance level being p < 0.05 where 𝜇1 represents the average CO2 emissions for a certain country in 1992 and 𝜇2 represents the average CO2 emissions of a certain country in 2018. The response variable will be CO2 emissions corresponding to the years between 1992 and 2018. We will report the confidence interval and the p-value, as well as include visualizations of the relationship between time and CO2. Regardless of the outcome, we will include the findings in our final report."
